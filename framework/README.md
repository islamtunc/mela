# Mela Framework

The Mela Framework provides a basic structure and helper functions for building applications with the Mela programming language. It is designed to help you organize your code, use standard library features, and get started quickly.

## Features
- Application skeleton (main.mela)
- Integration with the standard library (stdlib.asm)
- Example of input/output and function usage
- Extendable for your own needs

## Getting Started
1. Copy `main.mela` as a starting point for your project.
2. Use functions from the standard library for common tasks.
3. Add your own modules and logic as needed.

## Example Structure
```
framework/
  main.mela
  README.md
```

## Example main.mela
See the `main.mela` file for a minimal Mela application example.
